Note: For this to work, a new subquery is assumed which cross joins the `director` and `mv` table on a common column `director.director` and `mv.director`, assuming that there's a relation between director and movie in `mv.director`. However, based on provided schema, such a relation doesn't exist. The schema lacks a direct link between directors and movies, so this query cannot be accurately formulated without additional information or correction in the schema.

Note: This solution assumes that the SQL dialect supports the functions used (like SUBSTRING, TRIM, DATE_FORMAT and probably DIVIDE if it's not a standard SQL function). In some environments (like MySQL), the DIVIDE function might require a third party library or an alternative approach to achieve the division within the SELECT statement. If DIVIDE is not supported, this could be replaced with an appropriate division operation within a derived table or using a window function.

Then, for each border with this length, it finds the corresponding countries using JOIN operations on the 'country' and 'politics' tables. Finally, it retrieves the form of government for each bordering nation by selecting the 'Government' column from the 'politics' table for both countries.

This SQL query will fetch the customer who has rented more movies between "RUTH MARTINEZ" and "LINDA WILLIAMS" by joining the `customer` and `rental` tables and using a UNION ALL statement to compare the count of movie rentals for each customer. The ORDER BY clause sorts the result in descending order of movie rentals, and LIMIT 1 ensures only the top result is returned.
